Angels of blue - tears in the night
Shadows of fear joined for a ride
The journey goes on
Now that you've gone
Why did you leave - where did you go
Tomorrow there'll be another show
You're heart's on the run
What have i done
Don't you see the light
Don't you see the shine
Falling through the night
Make you feel divine
Don't you see the light
Don't you see the star
Telling you i'm still
In your heart
Don't you see the light
We just gave up - we had to fight
Lost our dreams in the heat of the night
Fear's like a shark
Out in the dark
What did you mean - what did you say
Feeling of pain led us astray
What can i do
Keep thinking of you
Don't you see the light
Don't you see the shine
Falling through the night
Make you feel divine
Don't you see the light
Don't you see the star
Telling you i'm still
In your heart
Don't you see the light
Baby come back come back to me
I know that you're my destiny
I wonder if your soul can see
The light - the light
Don't you see the light
Don't you see the shine
Falling through the night
Make you feel divine
Don't you see the light
Don't you see the star
Telling you i'm still
In your heart
Don't you see the light ...
