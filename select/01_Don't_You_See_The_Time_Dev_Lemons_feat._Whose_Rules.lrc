[00:49.04] I've been thinking maybe
[00:52.31] (I can't stop, can't stop)
[00:55.23] You forgot about me (You forgot about me)

[01:45.26] Give me a call when you realize what you've done
[01:50.55] But until then, we're not cool
[02:05.55] 
[02:04.83] You forgot about me
[02:16.25] You forgot about me
